Mining Hash - White Paper
Official document on ecosystem architecture, tokenomics, and NFT-based mining

Introduction
Mining Hash is a “green” Web3 mining ecosystem where the $HASH token is generated not through computational power, but through NFT inventory and user activity.
Developed by Look Hook Dev, a Web3-focused team building decentralized products since 2023, Mining Hash aims to make mining:
•	Accessible
•	Environmentally friendly
•	Fair
•	Sustainable
The project features no presales, no VC allocation, and no hidden emissions, ensuring a transparent, community-oriented distribution model.

Architecture and Smart Contracts
Mining Hash runs on the Base network (Ethereum L2).
Key contracts:
Contract	Purpose	Address
Inventory Contract	NFT devices	0x13CE10a3e09FA8000BA8A13fCbe8813f476584e7
Rewards Contract	$HASHcoin distribution	0xA9B631ABcc4fd0bc766d7C0C8fCbf866e2bB0445
Staking Contract	NFT staking & mining	0xBBc4f75874930EB4d8075FCB3f48af2535A8E848
All contracts are fully open-source and verifiable on-chain.

$HASH Tokenomics
•	Total supply: 10,000,000,000 $HASH
•	Distribution is fixed and permanently locked in smart contracts
Allocation	Share	Purpose
Mining	80%	NFT-based mining rewards
Ecosystem Development	20%	Campaigns, Dev, liquidity, partnerships
No private sales, no VCs, no presales - distribution is based solely on mining and ecosystem activity.

NFT Mining Mechanics
Mining is performed by staking NFT devices of varying tiers.
NFT	Price	Mining Speed
GPU	$1.99	0.042 HASH/hr
ASIC	$9.50	0.42 HASH/hr
FARM	$29.20	2.42 HASH/hr
RIG	$14.99	0.335 HASH/hr
RACK	$109.50	5.05 HASH/hr
CONTAINER	$290	24.2 HASH/hr
Mining Process:
1.	Acquire NFT equipment
2.	Stake inside the DApp
3.	Earn $HASH rewards in real time
Users can withdraw NFTs, stop mining, sell equipment, or claim rewards at any time.

Revenue Model From NFT Sales
All revenue from NFT sales goes directly to the team’s operational address and is used exclusively for executing the public roadmap, including:
•	Product development & maintenance
•	Liquidity support
•	Creation of new DApps
•	Infrastructure & backend services
•	User incentives and quests
•	Marketing & ecosystem growth
•	Operational expenses
Funds are fully transparent on-chain and not distributed to outside investors.

Mining Hash Ecosystem
Mining Hash is part of the Look Hook Ecosystem, which includes:
•	NFT collections & claim pages
•	Lock-staking & mining contracts
•	DApps: Name Service, Hash Market, DeVote
•	Community integrations: Guild, Intract, Galxe
•	Media partnerships: creators & crypto publishers
•	Hook Capital: on-chain transparent reserve fund
Each product adds utility and strengthens $HASH token value.

Security and Transparency Principles
•	Fully open smart contracts
•	Fixed tokenomics
•	No presale or private allocation
•	No hidden emissions or mint functions
•	On-chain reserves & revenue flows
•	Fair distribution through mining & activity

Conclusion
Mining Hash introduces a new era of Web3 mining - accessible, eco - friendly, transparent, and sustainable.
The ecosystem is built to grow, expand utilities, and remain relevant long - term. Partnerships, integrations, and CEX listings are actively welcome.
